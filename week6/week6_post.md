For each visualization, analyze: what's this visualization about? Evaluate its
design idiom, usage of marks and channels, user tasks, effectiveness and
expressiveness, and interactions.

![Votes from Labour vs Conservative](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SichangHe/STATS401/main/week2/vote_labour_vs_conservative.png)
From [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/08/world/europe/british-general-election-results-analysis.html).

This visualization is about the vote distribution in the British general
election in 2015 and 2017 and their differences.

It uses a hexagon grid map as its design idiom.
For the first two maps, the marks are hexagon areas and the channel is hue.
For the third map, the marks are arrows and the channels are hue and length.

The user task is to identify the trend of the distribution change and find
anomalies.

It is effective in that the view can clearly and intuitively identify the change
in the color distribution and see the length of the arrows and thus identify the
distribution change.

The interaction is in cursor pointer hover.
When the user hover their pointer over a hexagon on any of the maps,
all three corresponding hexagons in each map are highlighted,
and a card is displayed under the pointer to show a bar chart of the vote
distribution of that region embedded in a table chart.\
The bar charts use bars as their marks and hue and length as their channels.
